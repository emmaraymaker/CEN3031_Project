User stories:

  Frontend:
  
    1. As a professional actor, I want to be able to register for Actors Housing, so that I can access my online account.
    
    2. As an actor and potential lister and/or renter, I want to be able to use my login credentials, so I can log into my Actors Housing online account.


What issues your team planned to address:

  Frontend:

    We planned on tackling the issue of creating a login page and a registration page, so that professional actors looking for a roommate, looking to sublet, or looking to lease a unit could use their credinals to log into the Actors Housing website.
  
  Backend:
    1. Data structure to store members
    2. Data structure to store listings
    3. Query Function for members
    4. Query Function for listings



Which ones were successfully completed:

  Frontend:
  
    Both user stories were about halfway completed for the frontend. Registration and login pages were created with forms to fill out and submit user data.

  Backend:
    Both user stories had skeleton versions completed.



Which ones didn't and why?:

  Frontend:
  
    Both user stories were about halfway completed for the frontend because the accounts are not actually created or saved and the user cannot view their profile.

  Backend:

    Both user stories had skeleton versions completed. Set-up was difficult and one of our members had a minor family emergency queries were not able to be finished because of this
