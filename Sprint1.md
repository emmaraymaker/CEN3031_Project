User stories:

  Frontend:
  
    1. As a professional actor, I want to be able to register for Actors Housing, so that I can access my online account.
    
    2. As an actor and potential lister and/or renter, I want to be able to use my login credentials, so I can log into my Actors Housing online account.



What issues your team planned to address:

Frontend:

  We planned on tackling the issue of creating a login page, so that professional actors looking for a roommate, looking to sublet, or looking to lease a unit could use their credinals to log into the Actors Housing website.

Which ones were successfully completed:

  Frontend:
  
    Both user stories were about halfway completed for the frontend. Registration and login pages were created with forms to fill out and submit user data.

Which ones didn't and why?:

  Frontend:
  
    Both user stories were about halfway completed for the frontend because the accounts are not actually created or saved and the user cannot view their profile.
