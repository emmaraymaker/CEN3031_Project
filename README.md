# CEN3031_Project

Project Name:
  Actors Housing

Project Description:
  Website where actors in NYC can find and list housing. Actors will register using their Actors Equity Union number to verify they are a professional in the field, 
  as well as a valid email address. An actor can either create a housing listing or search for a listing that matches their needs and timelines.
  Users will be able to specify specific criteria within their lists/searches, such as: dates, price, number of roommates, whether pets or couples are allowed, 
  if they are only seeking female/male roomates, etc. These features will make it easier for professional actors that travel for work to find their ideal short- or long-term leases. The technologies that will be used to create the website include Golang by the backend engineers, and Angular by the frontend engineers.

Team Members: Tanner Lane (Back-end), Corbin Burditt (back-end), Emma Raymaker (front-end), Rosalinda Ramirez (front-end)
