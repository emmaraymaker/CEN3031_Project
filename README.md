# CEN3031_Project

Project Name:
  Actors Housing

Project Description:
  
  Website where actors in NYC can find and list housing. Actors will register using their Actors Equity Union number to verify they are a professional in the field of live theatrical performance, 
  as well as a valid email address. An actor can either update their profile, create a housing listing or search for a listing that matches their needs and timelines.
  Users will be able to specify specific criteria within their lists/searches, such as: dates, price, number of roommates, whether pets or couples are allowed, 
  if they are only seeking female/male roomates, etc. If a user is interested in a listing, they will be able to indicate so and send their profile information to the lister. These features will make it easier for professional actors that travel for work to find their ideal short- or long-term leases. 
  
Mission Statement  
We believe this project is important as it will help our actors, those who inspire and create, in their journeys. It's to this ideal we hold to, to help those who inspire us.
  
The technologies that will be used to create the website include Golang by the backend engineers, and Angular by the frontend engineers.
