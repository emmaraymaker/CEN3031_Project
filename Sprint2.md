Detail work you've completed in Sprint 2

For sprint 2 we were able to make progress on the uncompleted issues from sprint 1. We added on to our implementations of the login and registration pages for both the backend and the frontend. We were not able to fully integrate the frontend and the backend and plan to continue working on the issues. The frontend presents users with the option to login or register. Once the integration is successfully completed the user information entered in the registration form will be stored in the backend, and used to verify user credentials upon logging in.
