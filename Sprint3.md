Detail work you've completed in Sprint 3

In Sprint 3 we were able to make progress on the uncompleted issues from Sprint 2. We improved our implementation of the backend and frontend regarding the login and registration pages. We discovered new issues such as allowing the user the functionality of adding a listing. We successfully created a listing component that takes in and stores the userâ€™s listing information.
