Detail work you've completed in Sprint 3

In Sprint 3 we were able to make progress on the uncompleted issues from Sprint 2. We improved our implementation of the backend and frontend regarding the login and registration pages. We discovered new issues such as allowing the user the functionality of adding a listing. We successfully created a listing component that takes in and stores the userâ€™s listing information.


List frontend unit tests:

-Check is AppComponent mounts

-Check is AppComponent page is titled "Actor's Housing"

-Check if Login page mounts

-Check if Login page's email and password forms are initially blank

-Check if Registration page mounts

-Check if Registration page's first name, last name, id, email, password, and confirm password forms are initially blank

-Check if users and listings can be retrieved from the data structures correctly

-Check if users and listings can be removed

-Check if users and listings can be instaniated
